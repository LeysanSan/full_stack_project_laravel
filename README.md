Link Shortener MVP

Project Overview: Developed a minimal viable product for a URL shortening service that allows users to input long URLs and generate short, shareable links. The application supports storing link mappings in a MySQL database and automatically redirects visitors from a short link to its original URL.

My Responsibilities: Designed and implemented the full application workflow using Laravel’s MVC architecture. - Built RESTful routes and controllers to handle link creation and redirection. - Applied Laravel’s built-in validation to ensure only valid URLs are stored. - Created Eloquent models and database migrations for managing link data. - Developed Blade views with Bootstrap for a clean, responsive UI.
Tools & Skills:

Laravel (PHP) for backend logic, Bootstrap for responsive frontend design, MySQL with TablePlus for database management, Eloquent ORM for clean data handling, GitHub for version control, and Laravel’s validation and routing features for secure, maintainable code.

Key Learnings: Gained hands-on experience integrating backend logic with a dynamic frontend, following RESTful API principles, and applying Laravel’s powerful validation and ORM features to create a reliable and scalable MVP.
